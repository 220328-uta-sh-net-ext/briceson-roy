# Cloud Computing

## What is it?

Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.

It takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.

Some of the most common services provided in cloud computing include:

- Email (i.e Salesforce, Gmail, Hotmail)
- Storage, BackUp and data retrieval (i.e iCloud, DropBox)
- Creating and Testing applications (i.e Azure, AWS)
- Analyzing Data
- Audio and Video streaming (i.e Spotify, Youtube)
- Delivering software on Demand

As of now the top 5 cloud providers:

1. AWS (Amazon Web Services)
2. Google Cloud Provider
3. Microsoft Azure
4. IBM Cloud
5. Oracle
